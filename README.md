# markdown-helper package

Markdown-helper doesnt render your pages as markdown, it simply provides the ability to override the opener for markdown files, delegating responsibility to another command. By default, we use *markdown-preview* to render markdown as it is selected. However, you are free to override the package protocol and supported formats.
